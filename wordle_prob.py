This program helps in solving Wordle puzzles.
It stores a list of possible solutions and prunes it down as you enter guesses.
Available commands:
prune wordl 00120
    Prunes the word list if 'wordl' was entered as a guess and the signal was
    â¬›â¬›ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ©â¬›
    where 0 is grey signal, 1 is yellow signal and 2 is green signal.
new
    Repopulates the wordlist with all words.
list [c|f]
    Shows the current wordlist, or their count if it is too long.
    optional parameter c forces count and f forces list of all words.
best [n=20]
    lists the next best n words to guess.
besth
    same as best but only considers words which can succeed.
score wordl+
    Gives the scoring for the 'wordl's provided.
compare wordl answer
    Gives the signal if wordl is guessed and the answer is answer.
exit|quit|end
    exits.
